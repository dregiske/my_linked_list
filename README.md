# Linked-List in C programming

My implementation of Linked-Lists using C. Uses various methods that manipulate or create linked-lists to store data for the user.

## Features
- Deleting functions
- Inserting functions
- Printing functions
- Free functions (proper memory management)

## How to run
1. Clone or download project files.
2. Open terminal in project directory.
3. Compile program: ```make```
4. Run program: ```./my_program```
5. To reset, clean program: ```make clean```

## Usage
- Create your own linked list to store your own data in `main.c`.

## File structure
- `my_linked_list.c`: Implements the functions for the linked list manipulation
- `my_linked_list.h`: Declares the functions
- `main.c`: Initializes a linked list and calls the functions from `my_linked_list.c`
- `Makefile`: Compiles the files using `gcc`

## Known issues
- Cannot take user input through terminal
